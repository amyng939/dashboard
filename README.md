# Find this project deployed [here](https://nyc-rodent-inspection-dashboard.streamlit.app/)!

I was combing through NYC Open Data having attended one of their classes and feeling more motivated to find something interesting to me. I came across a dataset of rodent inspections and thought it would be insightful to see how common rodents are checked for in our city. The biggest challenge I had with this project was figuring out how to work with such a large dataset (over 2 million rows) and condense it to just what I needed, as I realized after that GitHub doesn't allow files over 100MB to be pushed. I'd love to add more to this project, such as utilizing the type of inspection and results of the inspections to contexualize the visualizations further.
